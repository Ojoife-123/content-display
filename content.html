        <h1>A Taste of Lagos: A Culinary Journey Through Nigeria's Bustling Metropolis</h1>

        <p class="intro-text">
            Lagos, a city that never sleeps, is a melting pot of cultures, and its cuisine is a vibrant reflection of
            this diversity. While the city is predominantly a Yoruba state, you'll find a rich tapestry of Nigerian
            dishes, from local Yoruba delicacies to specialties from other ethnic groups, as well as a growing
            international food scene.
        </p>

        <h2>Staple Foods and "Swallows"</h2>
        <p>Nigerian cuisine is known for its hearty "swallows," which are starchy, dough-like dishes that are swallowed
            rather than chewed. These are typically eaten with flavorful soups and stews. Some of the most popular
            include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Amala and Ewedu Soup:</strong> A classic Yoruba combination. Amala is a swallow made from dried
                yam flour, which gives it a distinct brownish color. It's often paired with Ewedu, a green soup made
                from jute leaves, and a rich stew (or <em>buka</em> stew) with assorted meats.</li>
            <li><strong>Eba and soups:</strong> Eba is a popular swallow made from <em>garri</em> (cassava flour). It
                can be paired with a variety of soups, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Egusi Soup:</strong> A thick, savory soup made from ground melon seeds, leafy
                        vegetables, and assorted meats or fish.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efo Riro:</strong> A decadent spinach or fluted pumpkin stew cooked in palm oil with a
                        generous helping of meat or fish.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Iconic Dishes and Rice Specialties</h2>
        <p>Beyond the swallows, Lagos is a haven for rice lovers and those seeking other classic Nigerian dishes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Jollof Rice:</strong> This is arguably Nigeria's national dish and a staple at any party or
                gathering. It's a one-pot rice dish cooked with a rich tomato and pepper stew, seasoned with spices and
                served with a choice of meat (often chicken, turkey, or beef) and fried plantains (<em>dodo</em>).
                Lagosians are particularly proud of their smoky, flavorful Jollof.</li>
            <li><strong>Ofada Rice and Ayamase:</strong> This is an unapologetically local pairing. Ofada is a distinct,
                unpolished rice variety with a slightly nutty and fermented aroma. It's traditionally served with
                Ayamase, a spicy green pepper sauce made with bleached palm oil, locust beans, and assorted meats.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Street Food: The Heartbeat of Lagos</h2>
        <p>The true culinary spirit of Lagos can be found on its bustling streets. Street food vendors are everywhere,
            offering quick, affordable, and incredibly delicious meals.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Suya:</strong> A Nigerian street food classic. Suya is thinly sliced, skewered grilled meat
                (usually beef, ram, or chicken) generously coated in a spicy peanut and spice blend (<em>yaji</em>).
                It's a late-night favorite and an absolute must-try.</li>
            <li><strong>Ewa Agoyin:</strong> This is a beloved comfort food consisting of extremely soft, mashed beans
                served with a dark, spicy palm oil-based sauce. It's often eaten with the uniquely soft and dense
                <strong>Agege bread</strong>, creating the famous "Nigerian burger."
            </li>
            <li><strong>Boli (Roasted Plantain):</strong> A simple yet irresistible snack. Ripe plantains are roasted
                over an open flame and served with roasted groundnuts or a fiery pepper sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Akara and Pap:</strong> A traditional breakfast combo. Akara are deep-fried bean cakes, crispy
                on the outside and soft on the inside. They are typically served with Pap, a smooth, fermented corn
                pudding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fine Dining and International Flavors</h2>
        <p>Lagos's culinary scene is not limited to traditional fare. The city's upscale districts, particularly
            Victoria Island and Lekki, are home to a growing number of fine-dining restaurants that offer a modern twist
            on Nigerian cuisine and a wide range of international options.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Modern Nigerian Cuisine:</strong> Restaurants like <strong>Ìtàn Test Kitchen</strong> and
                <strong>NOK by Alara</strong> are redefining local dishes, presenting them in new and innovative ways.
                They use locally sourced ingredients to tell a story through their food.
            </li>
            <li><strong>International Cuisine:</strong> You can find almost any type of international food in Lagos,
                from Pan-Asian and Italian to Lebanese and American. Restaurants like <strong>Shiro</strong>, <strong>La
                    Veranda</strong>, and <strong>Hard Rock Cafe</strong> offer a taste of global flavors.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whether you're exploring the local <em>bukas</em> (local canteens) for an authentic taste of Nigerian culture
            or indulging in a sophisticated meal at a high-end restaurant, the food of Lagos promises an unforgettable
            and flavorful experience.</p>
